# Growing up I played a lot of soccer (or football). There has been a lot of hype around this 2022 World Cup, largely because of  famous internet personalties on TikTok. People are also really rooting for Messi (Argentina) to win his first World Cup this year, as it is his last World Cup. So naturally when I came across this data set, I thought it would be fun to explore and analyze international football matches! Also to see if I could predict the first four 2022 World Cup games only using this data (a combination of international football matches and FIFA stats). This will likely prove to be challenging, some would say even harder than winning the actual World Cup, but with some creative problem solving I believe we can get some decent results! Let's see load in the data and see what we are dealing with âš½

# There is a bimodal distribution for FIFA points. Most national teams either have 250 and 1250 FIFA points. We can also see a slight skewness to the right indicating that very few teams have FIFA points above 1600. The Kernel Density Estimation line helps visualize the general bimodal shape of FIFA points for each country.

# We we can see there is a strong positive linear relationship between the total points a national team earned and their respective FIFA video game points. Going based on a national team's history, it appears that FIFA does a decent job of awording teams with strong historical winning records (or a lot of games), with a large amount of FIFA points. However, their FIFA points model takes more into account than just historical record. A log transformation might help uncover some of the patterns here since the y-axis scale is signifcantly larger than the x-axis, but in general, the graph tells a story we would expect.

# From the first table above, we can see that out of the top 10 countries with the highest FIFA points at their most recent match: 7 were from Europe, 2 were from South America, and 1 was from North America. Europe having the most teams in the top 10 is not suprising as they are well known for having top quality national teams, but there are also a lot of countires in Europe. So, it is not copmletely fair to assume that their teams are the best international performers have the most FIFA points on average. 
# 
# When looking at the second table, South America has the highest fifa points on average. South America has some of the best teams in the world namely Brazil and Argentina. Having only 13 countries and some of the best preforming nations, they slide in at the number one spot. Europe falls second partly due to the large amount of national teams they have (wide dispersion of talent). Interestingly, North America falls second to last when looking at averages. This is likely because Mexico is really the only national team that preforms well internationally (outside of maybe the Untied States). Thus, the average is likely overwhelming skewed by small nations that do not have the resources to develop into strong international competitors.

# Interestingly, all of the continents preform somewhat evenly in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers and friendlies. There is only exception, which is the Oceanic islands. Oceania appears to do worse compared to other continents, but this is likely because the only team that is competitive internationaly is Australia (the upper outlier in the qualifiers and friendlies). I am suprised that Europe does not shine in friendlies or qualifiers though, as they have points that are significantly higher than most continents for World Cup matches. I was also intrigued by how well Asia generally does in inernational competitions. I feel as if they have underappreciated national teams compared to other continents. Lastly, the top outlier for friendlies is Brazil, and due to their strong national team history and current FIFA video game ranking, this makes sense.

# The top 5 bars all occur when the home team either wins or draws. So this may indicate that a home field advantage could occur in international competitions, despite most games being played on "neutral" ground. Furthermore there is a quick drop off after the 0-2 score, implying that most games are low scoring in football, which is not suprising but it is reassuring that the data backs this up. Football is natorious for being slow paced and low scoring. To me, this is the charm as you can see plays develop out and everyone gets excited over a moment of brilliance. To some, they put a game on to fall asleep.

# A team's goal keeper, offense, defense, and midfield are all highly correlated with each other. Also a team's rank is negatively correlated with their team's fifa stats, which makes sense. Futhermore, the new variable we created Team_MA_pts. which takes the rolling average up until the last 5 games, is moderately correlated with TeamA results! Outside of FIFA rank, it may be the strongest predictor of a team's result.

np.mean(abs(check['TeamA_fifa_rank'] - check['TeamB_fifa_rank']))


# Most of these games that the machine predicted wrong were upsets, where the team that was ranked lower won the match. It appears that these games were usually large upsets too, as the average rank difference was 57. We could use clustering to identify variables that were influential in making these predictions, or in this case look at feature importance. However, that may not be necessary. Creating more accurate predictions with this dataset would be difficult. More data would likely need to be collected to make more accurate models. For example, a player report and lineup for each match would probably add more certiany. Perhaps individual top player stats for each team could be useful, etc. There is a lot this is missing here that could chip away at the ommitted variable bias here, but unfortunately we would not have easy access to all of that information. In other words, I do not blame the machine for predicting Germany to beat Nothern Ireland.

# The XGB Boost Model predicts that Qatar, England, Netherlands, and USA will be the first 4 wins in the 2022 World Cup! Furthermore, when looking at the winning percentages, the model appears to be pretty confident that each team will be the winner, except for maybe Netherlands versus Senegal.  

# # Summary

# We learned that the FIFA football game tends to rank South America and Europe teams higher. We also found out that all continents preformed similarily preform similarily, except in the World Cup games where South America and Europe teams tend to preform better. This does make sense though, as most of the top national teams have historically been from South America and Europe. As for creating a model to predict a winner of an international football match, we found that XGB Boost and Support Vector Classifiers preformed best. I could have chosen either model, but after looking at the XGB errors, I felt most comfortable with its selection, as most of its widely missed errors (strongly confident, but wrong) were upsets that most people would not have expected to happen. So, I used this hypertuned XGB model to predict the first four games of the 2022 World Cup, and as shown above, it favors most of the favored teams except for maybe Qatar. I did specify that Qatar was technically at home, so it may have picked up on some home advantage. Either way, it will be fun to check to see if my predictions are right!âš½
